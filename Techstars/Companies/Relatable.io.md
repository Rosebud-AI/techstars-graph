#### Relatable.io
Relatable streamlines how ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and hospitals source, compare and purchase medical devices. Our web-based platform connects providers and suppliers, standardizes how devices are objectively compared and provides analytics for smarter and easier purchasing â€“ all without losing sight of the clinical element. 

A lack of transparent pricing is contributing to billions of dollars in wasted spending on medical devices in the US healthcare industry every year. Purchasing medical devices today is unnecessarily complex due to a lack of data standardization, forcing providers into multiple analyst-heavy, offline contract negotiations in which they are disadvantaged by a lack of product & pricing transparency.management,  automated inventory management and any internal IT initiatives via API.
