#### CountertopSmart
The $30B countertop industry relies on the manufacture, distribution, and retail of massive "full-size" stone slabs (60sf). CountertopSmart is an online marketplace that makes it possible to buy/sell "partial slabs" at scale. It's great for buyers and sellers. Buyers enjoy a "full stone universe" selection as well as 60-80% savings and sellers add 20-40% to their bottom lines.
